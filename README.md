# Jellybeam
FEniCS/DOLFIN modal analysis of Timoshenko beams with FSI coupling using preCICE

## Roadmap

- Bending modes of Timoshenko beams
- Forced vibrations using extracted modes (e.g. Newmark integration)
- Cupling with preCICE and validation
- Coupled lateral and twisting deformation of the Timoshenko beam
